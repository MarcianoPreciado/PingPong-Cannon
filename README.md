# PingPong-Cannon
Arduino and Library code for my University of Utah, ME EN 1010, ping-pong cannon group project.
Members: Marciano Preciado, Matt Ludlow

  Each of the files in the repository include a simple diagram of all of the connections to the Romeo V2 Board, including defined variable names for each of the used pins. All pins names are defined in the PingPong.h file, aside from the servo object declarations, which are in the arduino sketch.

In order to use the CompetitionScetch.ino file in Arduino, be sure to copy the PingPong folder into documents -> arduino -> libraries
